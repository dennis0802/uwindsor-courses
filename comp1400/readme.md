Contents for COMP 1400 - Introduction to Algorithms and Programming I

This course is the first of a two-course sequence designed to introduce students to algorithm design
and programming in a high-level language such as C. The main objectives of the course are to develop
the ability to identify, understand and design solutions to a wide variety of problems. Topics include:
computer system overview, hardware and software, problem solving steps, concepts of variables,
constants, data types, algorithmic structure, sequential logic, decisions, loops, modular programming,
one-dimensional arrays, text files. If possible, problems like searching/sorting will be addressed.
