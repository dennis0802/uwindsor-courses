Contents for COMP2540 - Data Structures and Algorithms

An introduction to the programming and analysis of linear and non-linear internal (main store) data
structures and associated algorithms. Topics include the formal notion of an algorithm, elementary
time and space complexity; linear lists (such as stacks, queues, linked structures.); non-linear lists
(trees, binary trees); recursion; sorting techniques (such as heap sort, quick sort, merge sort, shell
sort.); searching techniques (such as binary search, binary search trees, red-black trees, hashing.);
algorithm design paradigms (such as divide-and-conquer, dynamic programming, greedy algorithms);
and applications.
