  <p class="indent">
    Right before the end of the Fall 2019 reading week, I went on a <b>road trip with some friends to go to Guelph and Toronto.</b> We went up to <br /> 
    Guelph to visit Brianna, a friend of ours, because she was doing her post-secondary education at Guelph, and we hadn't seen her in a while. <br />
    The plan began a couple days before the weekend. To ensure we had plenty of time to hang out, we left the Windsor-Essex area early Saturday <br />
    morning and planned to come back Sunday evening. Upon arriving at the place Brianna was staying, we were met by Paul, her cousin that she was <br />
    staying with, and Bella, his cat. To start things off, we began playing some games and then left for the main area of Guelph and eventually <br />
    Toronto, where we walked around and enjoyed the sights and food. The photo I took with my phone included in this section is a view from a bridge <br />
    we went across at Guelph. After some time, we went back to her place to spend the night and have dinner. To finish off the night, we watched <br />
    a movie for the rest of the night. Satisfied with the movie and our dinner, we went to sleep late to have energy for the next day's activities. <br />
  </p>

  <!-- Content paragraph 2-->
  <p class="indent">
    It was now Sunday, and we had a few more things to do before going home. Before leaving and saying our goodbyes, we enjoyed breakfast with Brianna.<br />
    We knew we would see each other again in a few months. Next, our group decided to visit one more friend, Nolan, along the way since it was also a while<br />
    since we last saw him, and he was presently attending Western for his post-secondary education. We met up with him at his dorm and went to a local mall  <br />
    to spend the afternoon catching up. After some time, we had to return home. Saying goodbye again, we left the London area for the rest of the drive home <br />
    to the Windsor-Essex area. <b>It was a great weekend where we got to catch up with ourselves, make memories, and refresh ourselves before going back to 
    school.</b><br />
