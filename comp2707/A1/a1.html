            <h1>About Me</h1>

            <p>
                My name is Dennis and I am a third-year computer science co-op student, minoring in mathematics. I am hoping to go into computer<br>
                science as a future career. My interests are in web development, game design, computer graphics, and software development.<br>
                My childhood was filled with technology, starting from learning how to use a computer and playing video games to learning<br>
                more about it today. This past winter, I worked for <a href="http://www.narmco.com/"><i>The Narmco Group</i></a>, an automotive company that produces high quality<br>
                metal stampings, roll forming, assemblies, and related servives to the automotive industry. The experience as one of their IT members<br>
                allowed me to apply what I knew about databases and programming in a real-world setting, which I found valuable. Currently, this is my 6th<br>
                semester at the University of Windsor. It's been an interesting 3 years with the pandemic and some negative experiences in between, but I<br>
                am still hopeful to see what happens during my time left at the university.
            </p>

            <p>
                For this course, I intend to learn more about web design, furthering my knowledge of what I learned from the pre-requisite course.<br>
                I came into the university with little knowledge on how to program a website. Thanks to the pre-requisite course, I picked up<br>
                HTML and CSS quickly. From reading the course outline, I hope to learn more web design, related frameworks, and apply my knowledge of<br>
                databases for a web environment. A prior co-op experience during Summer 2021 allowed me to see the importance of good web design when it<br>
                came to helping local businesses improve their digital appearance in the <i><a href="https://www.communitech.ca/about-us/our-operation/digital-main-street.html">
                Digital Main Street</a></i> program at <i>Communitech</i> in Waterloo. Overall,<br>
                knowing how to work both the front-end and back-end of projects would be valuable knowledge for the computer science field.<br>
            </p>

            <h2>Website with Good Design</h2>

            <!-- Embedding the website I think has good web design and my reasons for thinking so-->
            <iframe src="https://www.iheartradio.ca/am800" title="Google News" id="embedSite"></iframe>
            <p>
                Websites are designed well based on these basic elements of web design: <b>Content, usability, aesthethics, visibility, and interaction </b><br>
                (from <i><a href="https://www.resourcetechniques.co.uk/news/web-design/5-basic-elements-of-web-design-100152">
                5 Basic Elements of Web Design</a>)</i>. I believe this website has good design based on these principles which I can explain using these elements:
            </p>  
                
            <h3>Content</h3>
            <p>
                The content of a website should be relevant to what it's about. This allows the website to engage with users<br>
                and stay on it longer. For anyone interested in news for the local Windsor/Metro Detroit areas and information from the AM800<br>
                radio station, the articles and content engages with the user.
            </p>

            <h3>Usability</h3>
            <p>
                An unusuable website will stick out. Websites should be easy to navigate, intuitive, and accessible to all users,<br>
                no matter their device and network. The news articles can be navigated to one another and it's intuitive to navigate<br>
                the website. In addition, the website is usable when on a mobile device. Articles can be found in the centre of the page<br>
                with navigation at the very top and some side information as an aside.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Aesthetics</h3>
            <p>
                Websites should be visually appealing, especially for businesses who must reflect their brand image. Websites should<br>
                be able to visually connect with your audience. The website's colours don't distract the user from being engaged and<br>
                complement the radio station's brand image.
            </p>

            <h3>Visibility</h3>
            <p>
                Having your website being easily found is important. Using SEO (search engine optimization) is important to good web design.<br>
                Being a local news radio station, it can easily be found by residents of the region and anyone tuning in while driving.<br>
                When searching up the name on Google, the website is the 1st one to come up, showing good SEO.
            </p>

            <h3>Interaction</h3>
            <p>
                Your website should engage with your audience and encourage them to contact you. The articles and the option to listen from<br>
                the website allows it to engage with the audience. At the footer is contact info for the radio station, allowing end-users<br>
                to contact the radio station.
