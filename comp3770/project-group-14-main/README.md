    - Pt. 2: Online Features - https://ctl2.uwindsor.ca/uview/show/DB5328BC4CBE07F0/

**Note to Grader:**
- Start with "MainScene", this contains the splash screen and will transition to the other scenes
- All other scenes have only their basic assets (apart from camera and lighting)
    - Camera and lighting will persist starting from MainScene
- There are bugs we weren't able to solve in time, server host is unable to rehost after the number of rounds are done.
    - Currently, the server host will need to restart their whole game in order to rehost.
    - Certain audio effects might not play on the client or play more on the host
- There have been some last minute changes after the recording of the online features upon discovering some unbalanced features.
    - Some features might be different in the final version but overall demo should play out the same.
